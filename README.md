# image_captioning_keras
repository for image captioning with keras (deep learning)
This is a deep learning-based model in which we implemented transfer learning. we used VGG16 model for extracting features. Then we passed these features into a encoder decoder model to produce caption. This model is trained on Flickr8k Dataset.
